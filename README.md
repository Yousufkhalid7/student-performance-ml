### Student Performance Prediction System



A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts whether a student is likely to \*Pass or Fail\* based on academic factors.



The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to serving predictions via a Flask web application with a styled frontend.



##### -- Features

\- Predicts student outcome (Pass / Fail)

\- Machine Learning pipeline with scaling and evaluation

\- Flask backend serving ML predictions

\- Clean HTML/CSS frontend

\- Robust input validation and edge-case handling

\- Version-controlled using Git and GitHub



##### -- Tech Stack

\- Python

\- Flask

\- Scikit-learn

\- Pandas

\- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

\- Git \& GitHub



##### -- Project Workflow

1\. User enters academic details via web form

2\. Data is validated on frontend and backend

3\. Trained ML pipeline processes input

4\. Prediction is returned and displayed on UI



###### -- How to Run Locally



\- bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py



\- Then open the link displayed. For example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/



\- Input Parameters: Study Hours per day, Attendance percentage, Previous exam score



\- Output: Prediction: Pass / Fail
